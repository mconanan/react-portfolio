Module 20 Challenge: a react portfolio

This portfolio was created using react. First, pages were created for each of the navigation tabs.

Components were created to populate the pages with contect. For example, a project component was created so that props could be passed to it, and thus a bootstrap card of a project screencapture, title, description, and link to the repository. The project component was then placed in the Portfolio page. 

Header and Footer components were created so that a styled header and footer would persist throughout the website. 

The UseState react hook was used to handle state change, and to allow for navigation between the pages via the navtabs.
